# CS 307 Traffic Sim
A traffic grid simulator for CS 307 at UAH.

This program simulates traffic on a grid of roads. The roads have a speed limit and each intersection has a stoplight.
There are six different types of vehicle - a 4 cylinder car, a 6 cylinder car, an 8 cylinder car, a light truck, and a semi. Each vehicle has a different acceleration factor.
Vehicles move on the roads while obeying the road's speed limit and the status of the traffic light at the upcoming intersection.

A GUI for this program has been started but is still in the process of being implemented.
